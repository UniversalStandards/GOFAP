# ====================
# Configuration Notes
# ====================
# 
# Security Best Practices:
# 1. Daily checks ensure security patches are applied quickly
# 2. Grouped updates reduce PR noise while maintaining security
# 3. Separate major version updates for careful review
# 4. Labels help with PR triage and automation
# 5. Auto-rebase keeps PRs current and mergeable
#
# Customization Guidelines:
# 1. Add reviewers and assignees for your team structure
# 2. Adjust schedules based on your deployment cycles
# 3. Configure ignore rules for packages requiring manual updates
# 4. Set up milestone tracking if using project management
# 5. Add more ecosystems as your infrastructure evolves
#
# For Government/Enterprise Deployments:
# 1. Consider more frequent security checks (daily)
# 2. Set up required reviews for production dependencies
# 3. Implement separate test environments for updates
# 4. Document compliance requirements for dependency updates
# 5. Maintain audit trail of all dependency changes
#
# Integration with CI/CD:
# 1. Ensure automated tests run on all Dependabot PRs
# 2. Require security scans before merging
# 3. Set up auto-merge for patch updates after tests pass
# 4. Configure deployment automation for approved updates
# 5. Monitor for breaking changes in staging environments
#
# Monitoring and Alerts:
# 1. Subscribe to GitHub notifications for Dependabot alerts
# 2. Set up Slack/Teams integration for security updates
# 3. Review Dependabot dashboard weekly
# 4. Track metrics on time-to-update for security patches
# 5. Maintain documentation of dependency update procedures
