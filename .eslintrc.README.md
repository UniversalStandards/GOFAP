# ESLint Configuration

## Overview

This project uses ESLint for code linting with TypeScript support. The configuration uses a separate TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.eslint.json`) specifically for ESLint to avoid conflicts with the main TypeScript compilation configuration.

## Configuration Files

### `.eslintrc.cjs`
Main ESLint configuration file that specifies:
- Parser: `@typescript-eslint/parser`
- Project reference: `./tsconfig.eslint.json` (not `./tsconfig.json`)
- Extends: Airbnb, Airbnb TypeScript, React, and React Hooks configurations
- Ignored patterns: `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `public/`

### `tsconfig.eslint.json`
TypeScript configuration specifically for ESLint that:
- Extends the main `tsconfig.json`
- Includes all files that should be linted (including test files and JS config files)
- Enables `allowJs: true` to allow linting of JavaScript files
- Excludes only `node_modules`, `build`, and `dist` directories

### Why a Separate TypeScript Config?

The main `tsconfig.json` is configured for TypeScript compilation and:
- Excludes test files (`**/*.test.ts`) since they don't need to be compiled
- Doesn't enable `allowJs` since JS files don't need type checking during compilation

However, ESLint needs to lint ALL source files including:
- Test files (`.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`)
- JavaScript configuration files (`postcss.config.js`, `ecosystem.config.js`, etc.)

Without `tsconfig.eslint.json`, ESLint would fail with:
```
Parsing error: ESLint was configured to run on [file] but that TSConfig does not include this file
```

## Usage

```bash
# Lint all files
npm run lint

# The lint script runs:
# eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx
```

## Files Linted

The ESLint configuration lints:
- All TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) in `client/src/**/*`, `server/**/*`, and `shared/**/*`
- All test files (`.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`) throughout the project
- All JavaScript files (`.js`, `.jsx`) in the project root and subdirectories
- Configuration files like `postcss.config.js` and `ecosystem.config.js`

Files in `public/`, `dist/`, and `node_modules/` are explicitly ignored.

## Related Issues

This configuration resolves the issue where ESLint attempted to type-check files not included in the main TypeScript project configuration.
